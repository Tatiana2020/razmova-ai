## Introduction

This Privacy Policy describes how **Tarnovski Consulting** ("we," "our," or "us") collects, uses, and protects user information in connection with the **Razmova** mobile application ("the App").  
The purpose of this policy is to ensure transparency and compliance with applicable privacy regulations, including the **EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)**, **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA/CPRA)**, and **Apple App Store Review Guidelines**.

By using Razmova, you agree to the terms described herein.

## 1. Information We Collect

Razmova does **not** collect, transmit, or store any personal information from users.

- **No Account Registration:** Users do not need to create an account or provide identifying information to use the App.  
- **No Personal Data:** We do not request or process names, emails, IP addresses, or any other identifiable information.  
- **Local Data Storage:** All user conversations and preferences are processed and stored **locally on the user’s device**.  
- **No server syncing:** The App does not transmit, synchronize, or back up user data to any remote servers or third-party cloud services.
- **Optional iCloud backup:** Users may choose to include app data in their personal iCloud backups as part of their device’s settings. This backup is controlled entirely by the user and managed outside the app. All conversations and preferences remain stored locally on the device unless backed up by iCloud per user choice.

---

## 2. Artificial Intelligence and Processing

Razmova uses on-device artificial intelligence to assist users with language learning and communication.

- **Local Processing:** All AI computations are performed **entirely on-device** using the **Llama‑3.2‑3B‑Instruct‑4bit** model.  
- **No Remote Inference:** The App does not send user inputs, chat content, or outputs to external servers or third-party AI providers.  
- **Data Confidentiality:** No third-party organizations have access to user-generated content.

---

## 3. Analytics and Third-Party Tools

Razmova does not integrate any analytics, tracking, or advertising software.

- **No Third-Party SDKs:** The App includes no external analytics or metrics tools (e.g., Firebase, Amplitude, or Apple Analytics).  
- **No Crash Reporting:** The App does not transmit diagnostic data or crash logs externally.  

---

## 4. Data Retention and Deletion

- **Local Storage Only:** All data resides solely on the user’s device.  
- **User-Controlled Deletion:** Users can delete stored chats and local data at any time through in-app settings. Once deleted, this data cannot be recovered.  
- **No Cloud Backup:** As Razmova performs no remote synchronization, we have no ability to restore deleted data.

---

## 5. Children's Privacy

Razmova does not knowingly collect any personal data from children.  
Since the App does not track or identify users, it does not distinguish user age, we encourage parents and guardians to supervise children’s device usage.

---

## 6. Data Security

Razmova applies **privacy-by-design** principles by ensuring that all processing occurs locally on users' devices. No personal data is transmitted to servers.  
Apple’s operating system security features (including device encryption and app sandboxing) further protect user data by default.

---

## 7. User Rights

Because Razmova does not collect or store personal information, users’ rights under applicable privacy regulations (such as data access, correction, or portability) inherently apply — no identifying data exists on remote systems.  
Users can at any time erase all conversations within the app.

---

## 8. Policy Updates

We may update this Privacy Policy occasionally to reflect updates to functionality or legal requirements. Any updates will be displayed within the App and on our official website. Continued use of the App after updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Privacy Policy.
